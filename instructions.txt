Ingredients:

	•	For the syrup:
	•	1 1/2 cups sugar
	•	1 1/2 cups water
	•	1/2 cup honey
	•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	•	1 teaspoon lemon juice
	•	For the baklava:
	•	1 package (16 oz) phyllo dough, thawed
	•	2 cups nuts (walnuts, pistachios, or a mix), finely chopped
	•	1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	•	1 cup unsalted butter, melted

Instructions:

1. Prepare the Syrup:

	1.	In a medium saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 1/2 cups water.
	2.	Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.
	3.	Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
	4.	Add 1/2 cup honey, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon lemon juice.
	5.	Stir well and simmer for another 5 minutes.
	6.	Remove from heat and let it cool completely.

2. Prepare the Nut Filling:

	1.	In a bowl, combine 2 cups of finely chopped nuts and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon.
	2.	Mix well to ensure the nuts are evenly coated with cinnamon.

3. Assemble the Baklava:

	1.	Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
	2.	Unroll the phyllo dough and cut it to fit the size of your baking dish (usually 9x13 inches). Keep the phyllo covered with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out.
	3.	Brush the bottom and sides of the baking dish with melted butter.
	4.	Place one sheet of phyllo in the baking dish and brush it lightly with melted butter. Repeat this process with about 8 sheets of phyllo.
	5.	Spread a thin layer of the nut mixture evenly over the phyllo layers.
	6.	Add another 8 layers of phyllo, brushing each with melted butter.
	7.	Repeat the layering process with the remaining nut mixture and phyllo sheets, finishing with a final layer of about 8-10 phyllo sheets, each brushed with butter.

4. Cut the Baklava:

	1.	Using a sharp knife, cut the assembled baklava into diamond or square shapes. Make sure to cut all the way through to the bottom.

5. Bake the Baklava:

	1.	Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the baklava is golden brown and crispy.

6. Add the Syrup:

	1.	Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.
	2.	Allow the baklava to cool completely and absorb the syrup.

7. Serve:

	1.	Once cooled, the baklava is ready to be served. It can be stored at room temperature for several days.

Enjoy your homemade baklava!
